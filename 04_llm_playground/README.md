# 🧠 LLM Playground: Practical Workflows & Demos

This section is inspired by the book *Hands-On Large Language Models* by Jay Alammar and Maarten Grootendorst — a phenomenal resource for applied large language models. I’ve extended several labs with my own experiments and explanations.

🔍 Topics covered:
- Tokens and Embeddings
- Text Classification
- Text Clustering
- Topic Modeling
- Text Generation
- Creating Text Embedding Models
- Semantic search with sentence embeddings
- Prompt engineering variations
- Fine-tuning small LLMs on custom tasks
- Document Q&A with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Systematic comparison of open-source LLMs for reasoning tasks

⚙️ Frameworks:
- OpenAI API, HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain, FAISS, PyTorch

📚 Educational Intent:
This notebook series is part of my effort to help ML engineers and data scientists break into LLM applications. If you're learning or applying LLMs, I hope these examples and walkthroughs serve as a valuable resource.
