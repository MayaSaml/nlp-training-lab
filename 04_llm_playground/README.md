Educational Intent:
This notebook series is part of a broader effort to **share applied LLM knowledge** in a way that’s practical and actionable. These labs are intended for other engineers and data scientists building modern NLP and LLM-based systems.

**Note**: This section is inspired by the book *Hands-On Large Language Models* by Jay Alammar and Maarten Grootendorst — a phenomenal resource for applied large language models. I’ve extended several labs with my own experiments and explanations.
